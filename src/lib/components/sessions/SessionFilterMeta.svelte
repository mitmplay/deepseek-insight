	 * SessionFilterMeta — the filter row's meta controls in one
	 * right-pinned container (extracted from SessionFilterRow
	 * 2026-09-04): `All` (SessionFilterClear) beside the
	 * conversation-count/workspace toggle (SessionFilterToggle). These
	 * are NOT dimension pills — they are the row's state verbs: one
	 * resets EVERY dimension, the other sets the count/workspace view.
	 * Both build their FULL next state here and report it upward through
	 * onchange; the owner stays the state choke point.
	 *
	 * The [folder] ghost rule rides along (moved from SessionFilterRow):
	 * the registered-only view excludes ghost sessions, so a selected
	 * GHOST workspace pill would contradict it (and the pill hides) —
	 * selecting [folder] lifts the ghost workspace selection in the SAME
	 * change. Registered selections compose fine and stay.
	 *
	 * The container keeps its natural width (flex-shrink 0) and sits at
	 * the RIGHT end of its parent row — the right alignment comes from
	 * the SIBLING: the header's .head button flexes to fill the free
	 * space (flex: 1 in SessionFilterHeader), not from any margin here.
	 * No styling reaches the wrapped components.

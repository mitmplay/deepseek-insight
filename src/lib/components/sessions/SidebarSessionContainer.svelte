	/**
	 * SidebarSessionContainer — the sidebar's session-rows shell: the
	 * scrolling column assembling the separator and the filtered recency
	 * spine (SidebarSessionsList). The pinned panel group
	 * (SidebarOpenPanels) moved OUT to SessionsList (2026-08-26) —
	 * it now renders above the SessionFilterRow pills, outside this
	 * column. Purely presentational: data loading and filter derivation
	 * live in SidebarSessions (the owner).
	 *
	 * The workspace chip column ALWAYS renders, workspace filter or not
	 * (2026-08-24 revision): a spine row may sit in a DIFFERENT
	 * workspace than the active filter — its chip is the one cue saying
	 * where that conversation lives. A row without a workspace renders
	 * the empty alignment slot so the column never breaks.
	 *
	 * Split scroll (2026-08-24, revised 2026-08-26): the column's whole
	 * height goes to the spine — it scrolls INTERNALLY past its own
	 * limit, never growing a scrollbar of its own. The panel pane that
	 * once lived here is a sibling ABOVE (inside SessionsList's body
	 * column, over the pills); the body column itself never scrolls as
	 * one, so a combined scrollbar still cannot exist.

	/**
	 * SidebarOpenPanels — the sidebar's pinned PANEL rows (Panel Floor
	 * W4 task 4.1, ADR-0006 R5): one row per OPEN PANEL on the floor,
	 * rendered above the session filter pills — the FIRST block of the
	 * sidebar's session body (SessionsList), moved out of
	 * SidebarSessionContainer 2026-08-26 so the floor's live set stays
	 * visible without scrolling past the filter controls. Click selects
	 * the panel (registry action, leaf→root); the row's X closes the
	 * panel (workspace context state write, root-owned).
	 *
	 * Row grammar (ADR-0005, interior shared since 2026-08-26):
	 * status glyph + workspace chip + label — the SAME WorkspaceRowItem
	 * fragment the spine renders, so the two lists can never drift.
	 * Running sessions show animated stream bars, idle a static dot;
	 * the selected row is a LIGHT accent field (no color inversion —
	 * see the .row.current note for the contrast audit).
	 *
	 * Floor-aware but floor-optional: reads the workspace context; when
	 * no floor is mounted (home page, no route publishing state) zero
	 * rows render — the block disappears, exactly the pre-floor
	 * behavior of "nothing pinned here".
	 *
	 * Group box (2026-08-24): the open panels render as ONE detached
	 * group — alt surface, border, radius — so the floor's live set
	 * never visually blends into the filter pills below it.
	 *
	 * Move up/down (the vertical twin of the panel header's left/right
	 * chevrons): each row carries registry move buttons, hidden at the
	 * list's edges — the row list IS the floor order, so moving here
	 * reorders the panels on the floor and vice versa.
	 *
	 * Scroll pane (2026-08-24): this component's root is a flex pane
	 * in the sidebar's non-scrolling session body (SessionsList, above
	 * the pills) — NATURAL height for as many panels as the floor
	 * holds, hard-capped at HALF that body column (past the cap it
	 * scrolls internally). The spine below absorbs all the remaining
	 * height. No rows → no pane at all, so the pills head the column
	 * (no floor). The rows body — the interleaved panel/ghost sequence
	 * — is SidebarOpenPanelRows (extracted 2026-09-02) and the
	 * title's focused-name chip is SidebarOpenPanelHeader (same
	 * extraction day); this file owns the header row, the collapse
	 * state, and every action's registry/context write.
	 *
	 * Collapse (2026-08-26): the group ships EXPANDED since 2026-09-18
	 * (collapsed before) — the title carries the floor's focus (`Focused -
	 * <selected session name>`) in BOTH states. The
	 * name renders as SidebarOpenPanelHeader's chip; the ` - `
	 * separator stays text (unconditional since 2026-09-03) so the
	 * title's textContent keeps
	 * the exact `Focused - <name>` string the tests pin. The
	 * toggle persists per workspace desk (localStorage
	 * `dsi-panel-group[_<profile>]`, panel-group-prefs.ts), so a hard
	 * reload honors the last choice. Collapsed, the pane is a fixed
	 * header row; the pills and spine below absorb the freed height —
	 * pure sibling flex reflow, no layout changes anywhere else.
	 *
	 * Lineage fold pair (2026-09-03): the header row also carries the
	 * collapse-all / expand-all pair over every session that HAS lineage
	 * on the floor (a depth-0 panel with children, the same gate the
	 * rows' fold chevron renders under) — the seg-group lives in
	 * SidebarOpenPanelTree (extracted same day); this file derives
	 * the two disable facts, owns the actions, and persists every write
	 * through the same fold choke point as the row chevrons. A collapsed
	 * group arms both segments (nothing visible, no extreme is truth),
	 * and either click expands the group with the fold — a fold command
	 * must show its result.

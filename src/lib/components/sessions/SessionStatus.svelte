	/**
	 * SessionStatus — the shared session-status glyph (extracted from
	 * WorkspaceRowItem, 2026-08-26): running renders THREE ANIMATED BARS —
	 * a stream/equalizer glyph, staggered like the chat
	 * StreamingIndicator (the house pattern for live motion); idle
	 * renders the static grey dot. Same 0.5rem footprint in every host
	 * — the rows' geometry and the title chip alike.
	 *
	 * FRAGMENT BY DESIGN: one root span, no wrapper — the host's flex
	 * gap spaces it like any other child. WorkspaceRowItem renders it as
	 * its leading node; the panel-group title chip renders it beside
	 * the focused panel's name.
	 *
	 * prefers-reduced-motion freezes the bars at staggered static
	 * heights — still a distinct "running" glyph, never moving
	 * (WCAG 2.3.3).
	 *
	 * Palette (2026-08-26): defaults hold contrast on every field the
	 * hosts paint — white spine, the panel group's accent wash (14%),
	 * row hover (18%), the LIGHT selected field (30% accent) — so
	 * hosts override nothing except where meaning demands it (the
	 * dead-row override (--si-idle: red-800) in the panel group's rows
	 * and title chip). Ratios (calibrated script): idle #52606d
	 * 6.46/5.52/—/4.54. CSS custom properties (--si-run, --si-idle)
	 * remain the extension point for fields this file does not know.
	 *
	 * Run color is owned app-wide (2026-09-03): app.css defines
	 * --si-run red (#b91c1c) on :root and this file's fallback matches —
	 * the glyph paints red with or without the app stylesheet. The red
	 * is the palette's calibrated one (ratios under the delegation
	 * section below); the retired teal (#0f867a) measured
	 * 4.46/3.81/3.63/3.14 on the same fields.
	 *
	 * Four-state glyph (2026-08-27 lineage sidebar, ADR D3 — motion = me,
	 * delegation marked, not hue): the `delegated` prop (default false)
	 * marks sub-agents working; since run shares the red family
	 * app-wide, the ×N badge and the accessible name carry the
	 * delegation split:
	 *
	 *   running  delegated  glyph
	 *   –        –          grey dot (idle)
	 *   ✓        –          red bars (working)
	 *   ✓        ✓          red bars + ×N badge — working AND sub-agents
	 *                       working
	 *   –        ✓          red bullet — idle self, delegation live
	 *                       (the fire-and-forget parent: honest in both
	 *                       directions, never fakes motion it lacks)
	 *
	 * The ×N count badge (prop `count`, renders only when > 0) is the
	 * non-color carrier (WCAG 1.4.1 — hue alone can no longer split run
	 * from delegated): absolutely positioned outside the 0.5rem
	 * footprint, aria-hidden (the count also rides the accessible name).
	 * Reduced-motion freezes both states the same way.
	 *
	 * Delegation red #b91c1c (red-700), calibrated 2026-08-27 — channel
	 * fix vs the first script run ([0,2,4] on bare hex, not [1,3,5]):
	 * 6.47 white / 5.53 wash14 / 5.27 hover18 / 4.55 selected30 —
	 * clears 1.4.11's 3:1 on every field with margin. NOTE: the ADR's
	 * amber fallback #ea580c measures 3.56/3.04/2.90/2.51 — FAILS
	 * hover and selected; it is NOT contrast-viable. If review finds
	 * delegation red confusable with the dead tint (row-level red-800
	 * #991b1b: 8.31/7.11/6.77/5.85 — different scope, different shade,
	 * plus the ×N badge), the replacement must be re-measured, never
	 * assumed.

	/**
	 * WorkspaceRowItem — the shared INTERIOR of a session row (extracted
	 * 2026-08-26): status icon + workspace chip + label, the grammar
	 * ADR-0005 pins. TWO list surfaces render the identical triple —
	 * the spine (SidebarSessionsList rows) and the pinned panel group
	 * (SidebarOpenPanels rows) — and had drifted into copy-paste
	 * twins; this component is the one home for that markup now.
	 *
	 * FRAGMENT BY DESIGN: three root nodes (status, chip-or-slot,
	 * label), no wrapper — the host row (<a> in the spine, <div> in the
	 * panel group) is the flex container and its gap spaces these nodes
	 * as direct children. The host owns what differs (wrapper element,
	 * hover/current/dead states, trailing column: time vs actions);
	 * this component owns what is identical.
	 *
	 * Status icon (2026-08-26 stream restyle, extracted to
	 * SessionStatus the same day): running renders THREE ANIMATED
	 * BARS — a stream/equalizer glyph, staggered like the chat
	 * StreamingIndicator (the house pattern for live motion); idle
	 * renders the old static grey dot, same 0.5rem footprint so row
	 * alignment is byte-identical. prefers-reduced-motion freezes the
	 * bars at staggered static heights — still a distinct "running"
	 * glyph, never moving (WCAG 2.3.3). The glyph lives in
	 * SessionStatus now, shared with the panel-group title chip.
	 *
	 * Palette (2026-08-26 selected-row restyle): defaults are chosen to
	 * hold contrast on EVERY field the two hosts paint — white spine,
	 * the panel group's accent wash (14%), row hover (18%), and the
	 * LIGHT selected field (30% accent) — so hosts override nothing.
	 * All ratios computed against the WCAG relative-luminance formula
	 * (calibrated script, 2026-08-26): run #047857 5.48/4.69/4.47/3.86
	 * (3:1 need, 1.4.11); idle #52606d 6.46/5.52/—/4.54; chip navy-mix
	 * 4.94+ (AA, 9px text). CSS custom properties (--si-run, --si-idle,
	 * --si-chip, --si-chip-bg, --si-chip-ghost, --si-chip-ghost-bg)
	 * remain the extension point for fields this file does not know.

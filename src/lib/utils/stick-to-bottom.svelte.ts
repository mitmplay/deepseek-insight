/**
 * stick-to-bottom — the reusable follow-the-live-end behavior for ANY
 * scrollable element (extracted 2026-08-26 from ConversationScrollArea's
 * inline scroll-stick block, whose semantics are preserved exactly):
 *
 *   - content grows while the reader sits at the bottom → the element
 *     stays glued to the live end
 *   - the reader scrolls away → the pin releases (growth never yanks)
 *   - the reader returns to the bottom → the pin re-engages
 *   - a manual engage (a toggle) JUMPS to the bottom — the control never
 *     lies about what "follow" means
 *
 * How it watches for growth: a MutationObserver on the element's
 * subtree (childList + characterData). That is what makes it generic —
 * the transcript needed its caller to re-run an effect on every entries
 * mutation; any element whose CONTENT changes in the DOM (streaming
 * markdown, appended rows, growing text) just works, no data props.
 *
 * Second consumer (the extraction's trigger): the think popup — a
 * streaming reasoning body whose popup scrolls; opening it mid-stream
 * lands on the live tail, scrolling up releases, returning re-engages.
 *
 * Svelte 5 runes module: create() in a component's script (or another
 * runes file), read `.stick` reactively, attach via attachTo in a
 * $effect, flip via setStick from a toggle (StickToBottomToggle's
 * contract).

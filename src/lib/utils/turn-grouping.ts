/**
 * Turn grouping (OCI pattern adoption, 2026-08-21; merged-prompt revision;
 * open-turn absorption — The Turn Kept Whole ADR, 2026-09-03).
 *
 * The conversation renders in TWO groups, the way OpenClaw Insight does:
 *
 *   PromptBubble   — anything sent to the LLM (right-aligned, square
 *                    bottom-right corner). A human prompt and the harness
 *                    context injections that follow it (workspace
 *                    instructions · runtime context · skill catalog) are
 *                    ONE bubble: prompt text on top, ContextInjection
 *                    chips below — they feed the same turn.
 *   AssistantTurn  — everything the LLM produced for one contiguous run:
 *                    responses, reasoning, tool calls, unknown events,
 *                    PLUS any context injection the wire spliced into the
 *                    open turn's span (a background-job notice rides
 *                    inside as a chip — never a bubble that splits the
 *                    turn). (left-aligned, square bottom-left corner).
 *
 * Pure render-level rule (BC-E): `entries` — the ledger truth — is never
 * rewritten. A consecutive run of assistant-side entries becomes one turn
 * bubble; a context injection merges into the group it actually feeds:
 * the preceding prompt when there is one, the OPEN turn when assistant
 * work is its most recent neighbor (D1 — the wire spliced it mid-turn),
 * or a club of consecutive injections when no turn or prompt sits behind
 * it (D4 — session open). Turn key is the FIRST entry id so a streaming
 * turn keeps a stable identity across renders.

/**
 * Workspace context — the ONLY root→descendants STATE channel of the panel
 * floor (ADR-0006 R6, Panel Floor W3 task 3.3; consumed by the sidebar tree
 * in W4). Actions flow up through panel-registry (leaf→root); this module
 * carries the reactive workspace state DOWN: the open panels and the
 * selected panel id, plus the state operations the panel list needs
 * (select / remove — selection and removal ARE state operations, not
 * registry actions).
 *
 * Svelte 5 module-level $state in a .svelte.ts file is reactive for every
 * consumer that reads it (the same mechanism DSI's store/orchestrator
 * already use). The workspace route calls setWorkspaceState at mount and
 * null on destroy; any component reads getWorkspaceState().
 *
 * Plain data + functions — no component imports, no Svelte component
 * coupling: the sidebar tree imports only this module.

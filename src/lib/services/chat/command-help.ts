/**
 * command-help (2026-08-30) — the composer's `?` help intent: a draft line
 * that is a known command with `?` as its ENTIRE first argument asks
 * "how do I use this?" instead of sending anything:
 *
 *   /new ?            /permission ?            @<session-id> ?
 *
 * Pure detection + the per-command help copy; the popup is
 * CommandHelpCard.svelte, hosted by PromptInput beside the Suggest Strip.
 * Submit is guarded upstream (PromptInput): a `?` help line never reaches
 * parseCommand's execute path, so `/permission ?` can never hit the host
 * wire as a bogus preset and `/new foo` keeps its existing usage error.
 *
 * Trigger grammar — the TRIMMED line is
 *   - a parseCommand-known slash command whose args are exactly `?`
 *     (`/new ?` — trim- and case-tolerant through the parser), or
 *   - `@` + one non-whitespace token + whitespace + `?`. The mention help
 *     deliberately accepts a non-uuid token too: a new user asking for
 *     help rarely has a real session uuid at hand, and parseCommand's
 *     uuid gate would strand them. Nothing real is shadowed — a genuine
 *     message is never literally `?`, and `@foo` without ` ?` stays
 *     ordinary text (the parser's own passthrough rule).
 *
 * Mutually exclusive with the Suggest Strip by construction: the finder
 * triggers only on a LEADING `?`/`!`, the help intent only on a leading
 * `/` or an `@token ?` tail.

/**
 * Prompt Sync — the broadcast channel between the sidebar footer's shared
 * composer box (SidebarPromptSync) and the checked panel composers
 * (ADR "The Prompt Sync", 2026-09-04).
 *
 * The shape, in one line: the box is the ONE writer of a shared draft; every
 * checked panel mirrors it into its own draft; Submit walks the checked set
 * and asks each panel's own submit ladder to send what it shows; Cancel
 * restores the drafts each panel had when it was checked.
 *
 * Decisions this module embodies (ADR D-numbers):
 *  - D1 — membership is keyed by SESSION id (panel ids die at /new swaps;
 *    the recipient of a prompt is the conversation).
 *  - D2 — module-scope runes state read directly by both ends (the
 *    stick-to-bottom / workspace-context precedent); no prop threading.
 *  - D3 — the mirror is one-way, sidebar → panels; panels never write.
 *  - D4 — a check never wipes: `setSyncChecked(id, true)` snapshots the
 *    panel's draft into `pristine` and claims the panel only when the box
 *    holds text; claimed sessions mirror verbatim — '' included, so
 *    clearing the box clears their panels (amended 2026-09-04); Cancel
 *    writes the snapshots back.
 *  - D5 — `submitAll` awaits each member's `submit()` sequentially in
 *    check order; a refusal (streaming / locked / a `!` macro line /
 *    empty) keeps the panel's mirrored draft and lands it in `kept` (the
 *    pass ends the claims, so the post-pass empty never mirrors over a
 *    kept draft).
 *  - D6 — checks are session-scoped: `pruneSync` drops sessions that left
 *    the floor; `resetSync` runs in the route's destroy lifecycle.
 *
 * Plain TS + module runes — reactive for every consumer, no component
 * imports. The callers (Composer, SidebarPromptSync) hold the UI locks;
 * the store holds no timers and no fetches.

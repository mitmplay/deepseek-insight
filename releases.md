## v0.5.36

Bumped from v0.5.35 — Add Workspace flow fixes.

### Bug fixes

- **Add workspace: stuck panel after a successful native pick** — after the OS
  folder dialog returned a path and the adopt+create succeeded, the panel's
  `done` step left the dialog rendered with a permanently disabled
  "Add workspace & start chat" button (in the native flow `listing` is null,
  so the confirm button could never enable). The panel now dismisses itself on
  full success; it reopens showing the error only if the navigation callback
  itself throws, so a failure is never silently swallowed. Regression test:
  "a successful native pick dismisses the panel (no stuck dialog)".
- **Add workspace: the new session ignored the selected Agent** — the create
  POST sent only `{ cwd }`, so the fresh session always landed on the host
  default agent even when an agent pill was selected in the SessionFilter row
  (the pill visible in SessionFilterHeader). The selected agent preset is now
  threaded through SessionFilterMeta into AddWorkspaceButton and rides the
  create (`{ cwd, agentPreset }`), matching NewChatButton's grammar. No pill
  selected still falls back to the host default. Regression test: "the armed
  agent rides the create — no silent default".

### Tests

- 2 new regression tests in `tests/unit/add-workspace-button.test.ts`
  (24 total, all passing).
